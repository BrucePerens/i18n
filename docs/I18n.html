          <p>Translate a <code>String</code>, even an <strong>interpolated string</strong>. Check that a
translation for each string, into each language, exists at compile time,
and abort compilation with an error if one does not. Work-in-progress
translations can indicate that a compilation check is not desired.</p>

<p>An interpolated string is broken up into fixed string segments, and these
are translated individually.</p>

<p>The argument must be a constant string (including interpolated strings),
not a method, expression, or variable. This is because much of the
translation mechanism runs at compile-time.</p>

<p>When the argument <code>-Demit-translation-strings</code> is provided to
<code>crystal build</code>,
the compiler will emit a table of all of the strings that are provided
as arguments to the <code>t()</code> function, possibly including duplicates.
These are written to <code>STDOUT</code> using the <code>Crystal::Macros#p</code> method.
This table can be edited into a translation file by the
programmer, and is intended to be used by a task for generating such
files with machine translation (not yet written).</p>

<p>Languages are referred to using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag" target="_blank">IETF language tags</a> .
Two common
language tags are "en-US" for English as spoken in the United States, and
"en" for English not distinguishing where it is spoken.</p>

<p>Translations are defined in a <code>NamedTuple</code> called <code>Translations</code>, which
must exist in the program. Each
translation is defined as a tuple of a language tag and an inner tuple
containing translations into that language from the native language
used in the program (the "coding language"). Thus, the <code>Translations</code>
tuple looks like this:</p>

<pre><code><span class="t">Translations</span> <span class="o">=</span> { <span class="c"># Assuming the coding language tag is &quot;en-US&quot;</span>
  <span class="s">&quot;en&quot;</span> => { <span class="c"># English as spoken in most places other than the USA</span>
    <span class="s">&quot;the color of money&quot;</span> => <span class="s">&quot;the colour of money&quot;</span>,
  }
  <span class="s">&quot;es&quot;</span> => { <span class="c"># Spanish (not distinguishing Spain or Mexico)</span>
    <span class="s">&quot;the color of money&quot;</span> => <span class="s">&quot;el color del dinero&quot;</span>
  },
  <span class="s">&quot;es-MX&quot;</span> => { <span class="c"># Mexican Spanish</span>
    <span class="s">&quot;the color of money&quot;</span> => <span class="s">&quot;el color del dinero&quot;</span>
  },
  <span class="s">&quot;de&quot;</span> => { <span class="c"># German (not distinguishing Swiss-German, etc.)</span>
    <span class="s">&quot;the color of money&quot;</span> => <span class="s">&quot;die Farbe des Geldes&quot;</span>,
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>A constant <code>CodingLanguage</code> must exist in the program, and is set to a
string indicating the language used to write the native strings. So it
would have the form <code>CodingLanguage="en-US"</code>. <code>CodingLanguage</code> should
indicate where it is spoken, thus <code>"en-US"</code> rather than <code>"en"</code>.
This allows, for example, a translation to correct for
spelling differences between US English and the English spoken in the
United Kingdom ("en-GB").</p>

<p>A variable or method <code>language_tag</code> must exist, which is or returns a
string for the language tag of the present user. So, this would be of
the form <code>language_tag = "es"</code> for Spanish (not distinguishing Castilian
or Mexican Spanish).</p>

<p>Work-in-progress language translations are designated by modifying their
language tag with a <code>"wip-</code> prefix, so that the compiler does not test
those translations for completion. For example, a work-in-progress
translation into Spanish would have the tag <code>"wip-es"</code>. To test a
work-in-progress translation, <code>language_tag</code> must be set to the modified
form. It is possible for a work-in-progress translation and a completed
one to exist to the same language, for example <code>"wip-es"</code> and <code>"es"</code>. This
allows the same source code to work with a working-but-awkward machine
tranlation while a human translator produces a better version. </p>

<p><span class="flag purple">NOTE</span>  Complications of Translation</p>

<p>At some point you will be askng translators to translate your strings
into different languages. You will probably start with a machine
translation, but these can not be expected to be correct, especially
where interpolated strings are concerned.
There is not an exact one-to-one mapping of words in two languages to the
same meaning. Nor can you expect the order of words in a sentence to remain
the same, since grammars vary widely between languages.
Thus, a translation of an interpolated string can be awkward. The original
writer's assumptions about what belongs before and after any variables or
expressions in the string may not carry over to the grammar of the
translated language.</p>

<p>To delve briefly into just one of the many differences between languages
that complicate translation:
Many languages like English have no grammatical gender for nouns, while
others gender nouns male and female, male female and neuter, or common
and neuter. Some languages group nouns into animate and inanimate forms,
and some include noun class modifiers which indicate several different
forms of a noun. Such language differences can
require your translator to make assumptions about what you have
written. The default gender is usually male, which can lead to your
translation being masculinized in ways you did not expect.</p>
